## Introduction

Accurate prediction of crop yields plays a crucial role in agricultural planning, resource allocation, and decision-making for farmers and policymakers. This repository aims to provide tools and models for predicting crop yields using advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques. By leveraging historical data and relevant features, these models can forecast crop yields for different regions and crop types, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions.

## Models

The repository includes implementations of various models for crop yield prediction:

- **Deep Learning Models**: Neural network architectures such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) are utilized to capture complex relationships in the input data and make accurate predictions.
  
- **Machine Learning Models**: Traditional machine learning algorithms including random forests, gradient boosting machines (GBMs), and support vector machines (SVMs) are employed to build predictive models based on historical crop yield data and relevant features.

## Datasets

Several datasets are provided or referenced within the repository for training and evaluation purposes. These datasets typically include historical records of crop yields, weather data, soil characteristics, crop types, and other relevant agricultural parameters. Additionally, instructions for preprocessing and formatting the data are provided to ensure compatibility with the models.

## Usage
